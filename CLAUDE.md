# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

TALON HD is TALON (`../talon`, original IP) re-done as a solid-polygon vertical shooter for the 64 MHz C64 Ultimate
with a 16 MiB REU. Every ship is a flat-shaded 3D model, rendered **offline on the host** (orthographic, straight
top-down) at sampled orientations into software sprites of any size up to 512×512. The C64 only picks frames and
REU-DMAs their pixels into a double-buffered 160×200 multicolor bitmap (renderer vendored from `../gclass`).
Claude is also the **art director**: proposes and defends the look; the user approves.

## Rules

- **Four global colors.** All multicolor codes are global (`render::Palette`): 00 `$D021`, 01/10 the one screen
  RAM byte, 11 color RAM. Roles: 00 `void`, 01 `hull_dark`, 10 `hull_light`, 11 `hot`. One palette per stage; a
  write recolors everything (flashes, boss phases, stage transitions).
- **One REU image per level** (16 MiB each, art + music), auto-loaded by the PRG between stages.
- **Bible first** (planned TALON HD bible in `docs/story`, forked from TALON's): nothing is generated with Ludo for
  an entity that isn't approved; prompts only from `bible.py export-prompts`. Ludo models: `ludo model
  create-image` → `ludo model create --model hero` (GLB). Report credits after every batch.
- **Original, not a clone.** The polygon look is borrowed; no names, ships, stages or story from existing games.
- **Vendored code** is recorded in `THIRD-PARTY.md` with its source commit. Never write to `../gclass`, `../talon`,
  `../sueme64`, `../impact`, `../pummel`.
- **Rust:** edition 2024, zero third-party Rust dependencies; the shared library is `no_std` without `host`.
- **C64 Ultimate:** mutating MCP calls and device runs need the user's go-ahead in the current session. Never save
  config to flash.
- Commit only when asked.

## Commands

Host (run cargo from **PowerShell**: Git Bash's `link` shadows MSVC):

```sh
cargo test --release                     # renderer vs reference compositor, raster3d goldens
cargo check --no-default-features        # shared library still builds no_std
cargo run --release -- bake              # dist/talonhd.reu + output/{sheets,frames}/*.png, self-checked
cargo run --release -- preview --t 150   # one demo frame through the model
cargo run --release --example frame_stats -- dist/talonhd.reu 512   # DMAs / blends / I/O writes per frame
```

C64 (rust-mos + llvm-mos in WSL `Ubuntu-24.04`, paths in `scripts/env.sh`):

```sh
pwsh scripts/build-windows.ps1           # -> dist/talonhd.prg, dist/talonhd.elf
python tools/test_blit.py                # asm column kernel vs reference in a 6502 interpreter
```

Always run `tools/test_blit.py` after touching `target-c64/asm/blit.S` (the assembler silently mis-encodes
out-of-range branches). Hardware (`C64U_HOST` = device IP): `python tools/c64u.py config`, `run dist/talonhd.prg`,
then `upload-reu dist/talonhd.reu` (after run: REU preload overwrites on reset), `dump dist/dump --hold`,
`cargo run --release -- compare --dump dist/dump`.

## Architecture

- **One renderer, two machines.** `src/render.rs` is generic over `Hw` (`src/hw.rs`); on the C64 it is volatile MMIO
  plus `asm/blit.S`, on the host `model::Machine` (byte-exact RAM + REU model). Correctness layers: `tests/render.rs`
  (model vs `reference.rs`), `tools/test_blit.py` (asm vs Rust kernel), `compare` (hardware vs model).
- **Contracts** (`src/format.rs`, `src/layout.rs`): REU image `TALONHD1`; panorama = `BG_ROWS` cell rows × 320 B
  top to bottom; frames pre-shifted ×4 (or ×1, drawn at `x & !3`), column-major with segment lists. Memory map
  as gclass: buffers `$4C00/$6000` and `$8C00/$A000`, `SEG_BUF $C000`, `JOB $CA00`, `STATUS $CA80`, code
  `$0801-$3FFF`.
- **Vertical scroll.** `Scroll { coarse, fine }`: 25 rows DMA'd from row `coarse`; 24-row mode with YSCROLL
  `7 - fine` shows bitmap lines `fine..fine+192`; sprites are drawn `fine` lines lower.
- **3D bake** (`src/raster3d.rs`, host): mesh + `Orient` (roll, pitch, yaw) + `View` → `SpriteImage`. 4×4
  supersampled z-buffer, one key light (`LIGHT`), per-face Lambert quantized in half steps along each
  material's code ramp (half step = sprite-space checkerboard), emissive materials. Units: 1 = one hires pixel.
- **Tech scene** (`src/demo.rs`, shared, integer-only; `src/models.rs`, host): procedural stand-in meshes (not game
  content) — a 512×512 flying fortress swaying and banking across the top of the screen, drones, the player's
  fighter, a looping starfield/platform panorama.
